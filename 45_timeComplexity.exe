Time Complexity = the rate at which the time taken increases whith respect to input size

TC writes in big-O notation O(time taken)
TC compute in worst case cenario
avoid constent , avoid lower values

//example
if(int i = 0; i<n ; i++){
    //code
}
this will runs for n time 

types of case -> Best case -> least amout of iteration
              -> Avg case  
              -> worst case 

notation in case of time -> Big -Oh [worst case] upper bound 
        ->Theta avg Complexity
        -> omega lowest bound

Space Complexity -> Big oh -> size of instruction   
                -> memory Space
